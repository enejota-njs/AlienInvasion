# Alien Invasion

In a distant corner of the galaxy, Earth faces a massive alien invasion. As humanity’s last hope, the player takes control of a powerful starship to defend the planet. Armed with quick reflexes, precise aim, and strategic movement, you must face relentless waves of alien invaders.

This project is a digital recreation of that thrilling scenario, offering players an electrifying challenge that tests reaction speed, precision, and survival instincts. Whether dodging enemy fire or launching your own attacks, Alien Invasion delivers a classic arcade-style experience, brought to life with modern programming tools.

## Game Description

In the Alien Invasion adventure, the player takes command of a spaceship positioned at the bottom center of the screen. Using the arrow keys, the player can move the ship left and right, and fire shots by pressing the spacebar. As soon as the game begins, a fleet of aliens appears at the top of the screen, moving horizontally and gradually descending. The player’s goal is to eliminate these aliens before they hit the ship or reach the bottom of the screen. Once all enemies are destroyed, a new wave appears — even faster than the previous one. However, if any alien touches the player’s ship or crosses the bottom line, a life is lost. The game ends when the player loses all three available ships.

## Final Thoughts

This project is an academic work developed based on the explanations and guidelines in the book Python Crash Course, by Eric Matthes. The program itself was not originally created by me; it was written as part of my learning process, following the projects and examples presented in the book. However, some adaptations and details were implemented according to my own choices and decisions, aiming to personalize and enrich the final result.

I appreciate your interest in this work and I hope it serves as a reference or inspiration for other projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contribute or contact me.
